## 💭 Abstract
The Travel Tracker webpage is designed to enhance the travel experience by providing users with a centralized platform to manage their trips seamlessly. Users can log in to their accounts to access a personalized dashboard that displays a comprehensive overview of their travel history, upcoming adventures, and pending trip requests.

## 📝  Context
I am a front-end developer currently attending Turing School of Software and Design. I am in Mod 2 of the program where focus is on API's and iterators using vanilla JS. The project was completed week 6 of 6 in Mod 2.

## 🥇 Wins
⭐ One of the toughest things for me out of JS, CSS, and HTML is the CSS. During this project, I feel like I was able to grow in my knowledge and am proud of the progress I have made.
⭐ My code is organized and easy to read and doesn't have any bugs.
⭐ When I got the functions all working without too much time spent on any silly errors 

## 🚧 Challenges
❗ I struggled a lot with testing because of the coupling I did when creating my functions. Hindsight is 20/20 and I will definitely ensure testing is priority next time.
❗ I spent some time on getting my GET request to work and it was due to a small error.
❗ It is definitely a challenge when you get stuck and aren't able to immediately bounce the problem with someone else to try and solve it.
